# preworkstudyguide2
Messed up the file pathing on the first one. Please find the original repo on my profile for history/progress through prework. Here is a copy of the original README.

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to contain notes on the different subjects studied throughout the Prework course, such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JS. I have actually found this quite fun! (Except JS)

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section as they appear. If you would like a suggestion on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), or by right clicking on the page and selecting inspect, then console. A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first. I wish you happy and productive learning! <3
